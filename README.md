# SmashSmash
Smash game for demos

must haves
- start screen with just a name entry field and start game button
- when timer is up game is over and it posts score and goes back to start screen.
- background image
- background music loop - a bieber song of course
- sound effects when you hit him

nice to haves
- bonus streak scoring - if they don't miss 10 in a row the points double, same for 20 in a row and so on
- bonus image - another celebrity picture that randomly shows up
- bieber changes size to make harder as game goes on
